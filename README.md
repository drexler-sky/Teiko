# Cell Count Analysis Project

This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing immune cell populations from clinical sample data.

## Overview

This project includes:
- `count.py`: Processes cell count data to calculate relative frequencies
- `plot.py`: Analyzes differences between responders and non-responders to `tr1`

- SciPy

#### Input
`output_relative_frequency.csv` (from count.py)

- Displays boxplots
- Prints statistical p-values

#### Usage
Run the script with:
    python plot.py

### Statistical Analysis Results

The `plot.py` script conducts a statistical analysis using the Mann-Whitney U test to determine if there are significant differences in the relative frequencies of immune cell populations between responders and non-responders to treatment `tr1`. Here are the results:

#### Significant Differences in Cell Populations

- **cd4_t_cell**: This population showed a significant difference in relative frequencies between responders and non-responders, with a p-value of 0.0102. This suggests that cd4_t_cells are potentially more involved in the response mechanism to treatment `tr1`.

- **monocyte**: Similar to cd4_t_cells, monocytes also displayed significant differences, with a p-value of 0.0135. This indicates that monocytes may also play a significant role in how patients respond to treatment `tr1`.

#### Non-Significant Differences

- **b_cell**: No significant difference was observed (p-value: 0.7832), suggesting that b_cell frequencies do not vary notably between the two groups in the context of treatment `tr1`.

- **cd8_t_cell**: Also showed no significant differences (p-value: 0.6296), indicating their relative frequencies are similar across responders and non-responders.

- **nk_cell**: Similar to b_cells and cd8_t_cells, nk_cells did not show significant differences in their frequencies (p-value: 0.1156).

### Conclusion

The statistical analysis indicates that **cd4_t_cells and monocytes** are significantly associated with the response to treatment `tr1`, while **b_cells, cd8_t_cells, and nk_cells** do not show differences that are statistically significant. This information could be crucial for further research into targeted therapies and understanding the immune response in melanoma patients treated with `tr1`.

### Advantages of Using a Database

Capturing and managing our project's data in a database brings several practical benefits:

- **Reliability and Accuracy**: Databases help ensure that our data remains consistent and accurate. This is crucial for research where decisions are based on the data we analyze.

- **Efficient Management**: As our project grows and we collect more data, a database allows us to manage this increase efficiently. We can quickly find and retrieve data when needed without sifting through files manually.

- **Security**: Using a database means we can secure sensitive information more effectively, an essential feature when dealing with personal or confidential data.

- **Scalability**: Databases are designed to handle growth. As we add more data from hundreds or even thousands of samples, our database can handle this without a hitch.

- **Advanced Analysis**: With a database, we can run complex queries to analyze our data deeply, which is indispensable for uncovering insights and trends that simple data handling tools might miss.

- **Collaboration**: A database supports multiple users working on the data at the same time, which is great for team collaboration. It ensures that everyone can work efficiently without interfering with each other's tasks.

By storing our data in a database, we set our project up for smoother operations, more robust analysis, and easier growth management. Itâ€™s a foundational step that supports everything from daily tasks to long-term strategic decisions.

### Database Queries

#### 1. Count Subjects per Condition


    SELECT condition, COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id) AS num_subjects FROM Samples GROUP BY condition;

#### 2. Melanoma PBMC Samples at Baseline

    SELECT * FROM Samples WHERE condition = 'melanoma' AND sample_type = 'PBMC' AND time_from_treatment_start = 0 AND treatment = 'tr1';

#### 3. Further Breakdowns

##### a. Samples per Project

    SELECT p.project_name, COUNT(s.sample_id) AS num_samples FROM Samples s JOIN Projects p ON s.project_id = p.project_id WHERE s.condition = 'melanoma' AND s.sample_type = 'PBMC' AND s.time_from_treatment_start = 0 AND s.treatment = 'tr1' GROUP BY p.project_name;

##### b. Response Status

    SELECT CASE WHEN response THEN 'Responder' ELSE 'Non-Responder' END AS response_status, COUNT(*) AS num_samples FROM Samples WHERE condition = 'melanoma' AND sample_type = 'PBMC' AND time_from_treatment_start = 0 AND treatment = 'tr1' GROUP BY response;

##### c. Gender Distribution

    SELECT su.sex, COUNT(s.sample_id) AS num_samples FROM Samples s JOIN Subjects su ON s.subject_id = su.subject_id WHERE s.condition = 'melanoma' AND s.sample_type = 'PBMC' AND s.time_from_treatment_start = 0 AND s.treatment = 'tr1' GROUP BY su.sex;
