# Cell Count Analysis Project

This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing immune cell populations from clinical sample data and a guide for managing this data within a database.

## Overview

This project includes:
- `count.py`: Processes cell count data to calculate relative frequencies of immune cell populations.
- `plot.py`: Analyzes differences in immune cell populations between responders and non-responders to treatment `tr1`.

## Scripts

### count.py

#### Description
This script calculates the relative frequency (percentage) of immune cell populations per sample.

#### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas

#### Input
- `cell-count.csv`: CSV file with sample IDs and cell counts for various populations.

#### Output
- `output_relative_frequency.csv`: CSV file with relative frequencies of cell populations per sample.

#### Usage
```bash
python count.py

### plot.py

#### Description
Generates boxplots comparing the relative frequencies of immune cell populations between responders and non-responders who have undergone treatment `tr1`.

#### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SciPy

#### Input
- `output_relative_frequency.csv`: Generated by `count.py`, used as input here.

#### Output
- Boxplots displayed on screen.
- Statistical significance (p-values) printed to console.

#### Usage
```bash
python plot.py
